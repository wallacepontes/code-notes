# Mojo

## what is mojo programming language?

Mojo is a programming language created by OpenAI that's specifically designed for efficiently training large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) systems. It's optimized for running RL algorithms on distributed systems, allowing researchers and developers to scale up their experiments and tackle more complex problems.

Mojo aims to provide a simple and intuitive syntax while also offering high performance and scalability. Its design focuses on facilitating rapid experimentation and iteration in the field of reinforcement learning.

However, it's worth noting that as of my last update in January 2022, Mojo was still an experimental language, and there may have been developments or changes since then.
