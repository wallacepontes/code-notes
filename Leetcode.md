# LeetCode

I've been invited to take a TestGorilla assessment. It requires at least more than an hour to complete the assessment and I need to provide access to my camera while doing the test. Also, my browser will be maximized and they can detect if I turned it off and I maybe try to search or google for help or answers. I tried it even though I don't like these kind of tests since it seems like the company is a good place to work with happy employees but upon seeing the questions, damn, I wish I didn't, the questions are just too damn hard.
The problems are unrealistic and do not reflect the kind of work that software engineers do in their day-to-day jobs. The problems are typically algorithmic and data structure problems, and the software engineers spend more time thinking through problems and asking questions than they do coding. I have a lot concerns about this culture of grinding problems, where people spend months solving hundreds or even thousands of problems in order to prepare for interviews. This not only takes a lot of time but also teaches candidates bad habits, such as jumping straight into coding without thinking through the problem first. the companies should move away from TestGorrila-style interviews and instead focus on assessing a candidate's problem-solving skills and ability to think critically. The companies should be more upfront about what they are looking for in candidates and provide them with proper learning guides.

Hi Alejandro,

Thank you for providing the details for the next steps in the application process.

I attempted to complete the TestGorilla assessment as part of step 2. However, I have some concerns regarding this type of test. It requires over an hour to complete, along with access to my camera, and it monitors browser activity. While I understand the need for thorough assessments, I find that the problems presented are highly algorithmic and do not reflect the practical, day-to-day tasks of a software engineer. 

As an experienced professional, I believe that problem-solving skills and critical thinking are more indicative of a candidate’s capabilities than grinding through unrealistic problems. It would be beneficial if the assessment process focused more on real-world scenarios and the kind of work that aligns with the position.

I am genuinely interested in the opportunity at Kajae and believe I can bring significant value to the role. I hope we can discuss alternative methods of assessment that would better demonstrate my qualifications and fit for this position.

Best regards,  
Wallace

## This video is ranting about LeetCode, a popular website that software engineers use to practice coding problems for interviews. The video argues that LeetCode is a bad way to assess a candidate's skills and that it has created a toxic interview culture.

The speaker of the video says that LeetCode problems are unrealistic and do not reflect the kind of work that software engineers do in their day-to-day jobs. LeetCode problems are typically algorithmic and data structure problems, and the speaker argues that software engineers spend more time thinking through problems and asking questions than they do coding. The video also criticizes the culture of grinding LeetCode problems, where people spend months solving hundreds or even thousands of problems in order to prepare for interviews. The speaker says that this not only takes a lot of time but also teaches candidates bad habits, such as jumping straight into coding without thinking through the problem first.

The speaker argues that companies should move away from LeetCode-style interviews and instead focus on assessing a candidate's problem-solving skills and ability to think critically. The speaker says that companies should be more upfront about what they are looking for in candidates and provide them with proper learning guides.

I don’t think LeetCode is  an accurate reflection of a software engineer’s daily duties and it can be misleading for job interviews. by Coding with Dee 48,008 views 08 minutes, 02 seconds")
