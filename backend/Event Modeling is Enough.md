# Event Modeling is Enough

![Event Modeling is Enough](https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/d96/51c/b1a/d9651cb1a07bd38b0464ca24d47e9366.png)

This image is a humorous cartoon illustrating different approaches to software development and project management. On the left, a person is pushing a cart overloaded with various tools and methodologies, including:

- DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
- Retrospectives (Retros)
- BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
- Jira (a project management tool)
- C4 (a model for software architecture)
- Stand-ups (daily meetings)
- UML (Unified Modeling Language)
- User Stories
- Planning Poker (a method for estimating tasks)
- Event Storming
- Code Reviews

The person asks, "Is that all you need?" implying that a comprehensive and complex set of tools and practices is required for effective project management.

On the right, a second person is holding a single box labeled "Event Modeling" and responds, "Yes." This suggests that the person believes that Event Modeling alone is sufficient for their needs, highlighting a simpler or more focused approach.

The cartoon humorously contrasts the complexity and multitude of tools some believe are necessary versus the simplicity and sufficiency of a single approach, depending on one's perspective.
