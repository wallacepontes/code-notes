# Spring Boot and Spring Framework

## Spring Boot and Spring Framework serve different purposes but are often used together in projects.

1. **Spring Framework**: It is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications. It provides a wide range of features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, MVC framework, and more. Spring Framework is highly customizable and provides flexibility to developers.

2. **Spring Boot**: It is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that aims to simplify the process of setting up and configuring Spring-based applications. Spring Boot provides a convention-over-configuration approach, which means it comes with sensible defaults for configuration, reducing the need for manual setup and boilerplate code. It also offers features like embedded servers, production-ready metrics, and health checks, making it easier to develop production-ready applications.

While Spring Boot can be used to achieve a lot of what Spring Framework offers, they are not exactly redundant. Spring Boot simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications, making it easier and quicker to get started. However, Spring Framework provides more flexibility and customization options for developers who need them.

For a typical application that requires data retrieval and persistence, Spring Boot would be a suitable choice. Spring Boot includes Spring Data modules that provide easy integration with various data sources like relational databases, NoSQL databases, and more. It also offers features like Spring Data JPA for working with relational databases, Spring Data MongoDB for MongoDB integration, etc.

In terms of your requirements - less code, easy maintenance, lightweight, and high performance - Spring Boot can indeed fulfill them well. Its convention-over-configuration approach reduces boilerplate code, making applications more concise. Additionally, Spring Boot applications can be lightweight, as they come with embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty, eliminating the need for external server setup. Spring Boot also provides features like caching, connection pooling, and other optimizations to improve performance.

So, in summary, for most applications, using Spring Boot alone can suffice for data retrieval and persistence, providing a balance between ease of development, maintainability, and performance. However, for more complex scenarios requiring advanced customization, you may still need to utilize features directly from the Spring Framework.

## POM.xml

Certainly! Here's the updated `pom.xml` file including `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` for adding OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) documentation support:
