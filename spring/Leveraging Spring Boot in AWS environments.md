### Detailed Steps

### 1. Create and Test a Spring Boot Application

#### Step 1: Generate a Spring Boot Application

1. Generate a new Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or using the command line:
   ```bash
   spring init --dependencies=web myapp
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd myapp
   ```

#### Step 2: Write a Simple REST Controller

1. Create a new REST controller class in `src/main/java/com/example/myapp`:
   ```java
   package com.example.myapp;

   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @RestController
   public class HelloController {

       @GetMapping("/hello")
       public String sayHello() {
           return "Hello, World!";
       }
   }
   ```

#### Step 3: Package the Application

1. Use Maven to package the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

2. This will create a JAR file in the `target` directory, e.g., `myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

#### Step 4: Test the Application Locally

1. Run the application using the JAR file:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

2. Test the API endpoint using Postman or Insomnia:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/hello`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Expected Response: `Hello, World!`

### 2. Create a VPC in AWS

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and open the VPC Dashboard.
2. Click on "Create VPC".
3. Choose "VPC only" and provide the following details:
   - **Name tag**: `my-vpc`
   - **IPv4 CIDR block**: `10.0.0.0/16`
4. Click "Create VPC".

### 3. Create a Security Group

1. In the VPC Dashboard, click on "Security Groups" in the left-hand menu.
2. Click "Create security group".
3. Provide the following details:
   - **Name tag**: `my-sg`
   - **Description**: `Security group for my Spring Boot app`
   - **VPC**: Select `my-vpc`
4. Add the following inbound rules:
   - **Type**: `SSH`, **Port range**: `22`, **Source**: `YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/32` (for SSH access)
   - **Type**: `HTTP`, **Port range**: `80`, **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (for public access)
   - **Type**: `Custom TCP Rule`, **Port range**: `8080`, **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (for Spring Boot app)
   - Note: Replace `YOUR-IP-ADDRESS` with your own IP address to restrict SSH access for security purposes.
5. Click "Create security group".
