Here's a high-level system architecture for your data migration solution using Spring Batch for the backend and React for the dashboard in an on-premise environment:

### 1. **Frontend (React Dashboard)**
   - **Purpose**: User-friendly interface for monitoring and managing the migration process.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Migration Configuration Panel**: Allows users to set migration parameters like batch size, schedules, etc.
     - **Progress Monitoring**: Displays real-time progress, success/failure rates, and statistics for each migration window.
     - **Error Handling & Reporting**: Shows errors and issues that occurred during the migration, providing detailed logs and retry options.
     - **Scheduling Management**: Interface to define the migration schedule, break migration into windows, and monitor scheduled jobs.

### 2. **Backend (Spring Boot + Spring Batch)**
   - **Purpose**: Responsible for handling the core migration process.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Spring Batch Jobs**: For processing large volumes of data in small chunks (configurable batch size). The number of customers to migrate in each window can be defined at runtime.
     - **Job Scheduler**: To manage and trigger jobs based on the predefined schedule (could integrate with Spring’s TaskScheduler or a custom scheduler).
     - **Data Readers**:
       - **Legacy System Reader**: Extract data from the legacy systems (could be implemented using JDBC, flat file readers, or other mechanisms based on the legacy system's interface).
     - **Processors**: Apply transformations, cleansing, or validation to the customer data.
     - **Writers**: Store the transformed data into the new system (target system integration via REST API, JDBC, etc.).
     - **Chunking**: Spring Batch will handle processing in chunks (e.g., migrating 10,000 customers per chunk, depending on system load).
     - **Transaction Management**: Ensure consistent data migration with rollbacks on failure and retry mechanisms.
     - **Error Handling & Recovery**: Fault tolerance in the case of partial failures, such as retrying failed migrations and logging issues.

### 3. **Database Layer**
   - **Source Database**: The legacy system(s) containing the original customer data.
   - **Target Database**: The new system where data will be migrated.
   - **Migration Control DB**: An intermediary database to store metadata about the migration (job status, logs, errors, retries, checkpoints).

### 4. **Scheduling and Window Management**
   - **Window Definition**: Each migration window will be defined dynamically, based on conditions such as system load, business hours, and the number of customers to be migrated in that window.
   - **Schedule Coordination**: The system will handle different time windows for migration to avoid conflicts with business operations. Jobs can be triggered automatically based on defined schedules.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Centralized Logging**: Use tools like Logback or SLF4J for logging job progress and error reporting.
   - **Job Monitoring**: Track each job’s status (e.g., success, failure, percentage completed) and present it on the React dashboard.
   - **Notifications**: Integrate with a notification system (e.g., email, SMS) to alert stakeholders when jobs complete or fail.

### 6. **Scalability and Performance Optimization**
   - **Parallel Processing**: Use Spring Batch’s built-in parallelism (e.g., multi-threading, partitioning) to improve migration speed.
   - **Load Balancing**: If needed, the system should balance loads between multiple processing nodes, ensuring that no system gets overloaded during migration.
   - **Checkpointing**: Spring Batch supports saving the state of jobs at checkpoints, allowing recovery in case of failures.

### 7. **Security**
   - **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access to both the React dashboard and backend systems using OAuth or JWT-based security.
   - **Data Encryption**: Ensure that customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Limit access to migration controls based on user roles.

### Flow Overview:
1. **Configuration and Scheduling**: Users define migration windows, batch size, and schedules through the React dashboard.
2. **Job Execution**: Spring Batch picks up the jobs based on the schedule, reads customer data from the legacy system, processes it, and writes it to the target system.
3. **Monitoring**: As jobs run, the React dashboard displays real-time progress and any issues that arise. 
4. **Error Handling and Reporting**: In case of failure, jobs can be retried from the last successful checkpoint.
5. **Completion**: Upon completion, the system sends notifications, and users can generate reports on the migration outcome.

This architecture is designed to ensure flexibility, scalability, and reliability for migrating large volumes of data in a controlled, scheduled manner.

## Using Swagger (OpenAPI) to assist

Using Swagger (OpenAPI) to assist the frontend in controlling and monitoring activities related to the migration process is a great approach. It allows you to define, document, and expose RESTful APIs that the React dashboard can consume to control and visualize the migration process. Here’s how Swagger would play a role for each activity you mentioned:

### 1. **Monitoring CPU and Memory Usage**
   - **API Endpoint**: Expose a REST API to gather system metrics like CPU and memory usage. The backend would collect this data using system monitoring tools like `OperatingSystemMXBean` in Java or other third-party libraries (e.g., Micrometer).
   - **Swagger Definition**: Document endpoints that return real-time CPU and memory usage in a JSON format.
     - **Endpoint Example**: `GET /system/metrics`
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "cpuUsage": 75.5,
         "memoryUsage": 65.3,
         "availableMemory": 2048
       }
       ```
   - **Frontend (React)**: Fetch this data periodically and display it on the dashboard, possibly with a graph or live metrics display.

### 2. **Managing Number of Threads (Increasing or Decreasing)**
   - **API Endpoint**: Create APIs that allow dynamic configuration of thread pools, specifically the number of threads used in the Spring Batch job execution.
   - **Swagger Definition**: Document endpoints that allow the frontend to adjust the number of threads for parallel processing.
     - **Endpoint Example**: `POST /batch/config/threads`
     - **Request Body**:
       ```json
       {
         "threadCount": 10
       }
       ```
   - **Frontend (React)**: The user can control the number of threads through the dashboard, where this setting could be adjusted based on load or performance needs. This ensures the flexibility to tune performance during migrations.

### 3. **Error Logs**
   - **API Endpoint**: Create an API that fetches error logs related to the migration process. These logs could be stored in a file or database and retrieved via a REST API.
   - **Swagger Definition**: Define an endpoint that allows the frontend to pull error logs in a paginated or filtered manner.
     - **Endpoint Example**: `GET /migration/errors?page=1&size=20`
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "logs": [
           {
             "timestamp": "2024-10-02T10:15:30",
             "level": "ERROR",
             "message": "Failed to migrate customer with ID 12345"
           },
           {
             "timestamp": "2024-10-02T10:16:00",
             "level": "WARNING",
             "message": "Retrying migration for customer with ID 54321"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
   - **Frontend (React)**: Display these logs in a user-friendly format, allowing the user to filter or search errors and drill down into specific issues.

### 4. **Progress Bar for Customer Migration**
   - **API Endpoint**: Create an API that tracks and returns the progress of the migration, i.e., how many customers have been migrated versus the total.
   - **Swagger Definition**: Define an endpoint that returns the migration progress in real-time.
     - **Endpoint Example**: `GET /migration/progress`
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "totalCustomers": 10000000,
         "migratedCustomers": 3500000,
         "percentageComplete": 35
       }
       ```
   - **Frontend (React)**: This data can be used to display a progress bar on the dashboard, showing the percentage of customers successfully migrated.

### Additional Features Swagger Can Support:
#### 5. **Starting, Pausing, and Stopping Migration Jobs**
   - **API Endpoint**: Expose control operations such as starting, pausing, or stopping the migration process via REST endpoints.
   - **Swagger Definition**:
     - **Start Migration**: `POST /migration/start`
     - **Pause Migration**: `POST /migration/pause`
     - **Stop Migration**: `POST /migration/stop`

#### 6. **Defining and Scheduling Migration Windows**
   - **API Endpoint**: Create endpoints to define and schedule migration windows dynamically.
   - **Swagger Definition**: Document an endpoint that accepts a schedule configuration (time windows, batch size, etc.).
     - **Endpoint Example**: `POST /migration/schedule`
     - **Request Body**:
       ```json
       {
         "startTime": "2024-10-10T00:00:00",
         "endTime": "2024-10-10T04:00:00",
         "batchSize": 5000
       }
       ```

### Workflow Integration:
1. **API Design & Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI helps define the contract for all these operations. You can expose these APIs via Spring Boot and automatically generate interactive Swagger documentation (e.g., using `springdoc-openapi`).
2. **React Frontend Integration**: The React dashboard can interact with the backend by consuming these APIs. Swagger also allows you to auto-generate client SDKs for the frontend in JavaScript, simplifying integration.
3. **Security Considerations**: Swagger allows you to document and enforce security mechanisms such as OAuth2, JWT, or API keys for each endpoint.

By leveraging Swagger for API documentation, the frontend developers will have a clear and interactive guide to all migration control activities. It provides a single source of truth for how the backend functions, ensuring smooth integration.
