# Java 8 to beyond - evolution

## What are the new features introduced from Java 8 to Java 22 for multithreading?
From Java 8 to Java 22, several features and improvements have been introduced to enhance multithreading capabilities. Here's a summary of the key features introduced across these versions:

### Java 8
1. **CompletableFuture**: A flexible Future implementation that allows combining multiple asynchronous tasks and handling results and errors in a more streamlined way.
2. **Streams API**: Provides parallel processing capabilities using the `parallelStream()` method, enabling parallel execution of stream operations.

### Java 9
1. **CompletableFuture Enhancements**: Additional methods like `orTimeout`, `completeOnTimeout`, `delayedExecutor`, and more to better control asynchronous computations.
2. **Process API Improvements**: New methods in `ProcessHandle` to get information about and control processes, useful for managing external processes in a multithreaded context.

### Java 10
1. **Local-Variable Type Inference**: While not directly related to multithreading, this feature (`var` keyword) can simplify code in multithreaded applications, making it more readable and concise.

### Java 11
1. **Flight Recorder**: A performance monitoring tool that can be used to analyze and troubleshoot issues in multithreaded applications.

### Java 12
1. **Teardown Method for `ThreadLocalRandom`**: Improved performance for `ThreadLocalRandom` in multi-threaded environments by introducing a teardown method to clear the seed upon thread termination.

### Java 13
- No significant multithreading-specific features.

### Java 14
1. **JEP 353: Reimplement the Legacy Socket API**: Enhances the underlying implementation of the socket API for better performance and scalability in multithreaded applications.

### Java 15
- No significant multithreading-specific features.

### Java 16
1. **JEP 376: ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing**: Enhances the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) for better handling of thread stacks in concurrent environments.

### Java 17 (LTS)
1. **JEP 356: Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**: Provides new interfaces and implementations for pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) that are useful in concurrent applications.

### Java 18
1. **JEP 428: Structured Concurrency (Incubator)**: Simplifies multithreaded programming by introducing structured concurrency APIs to help handle multiple threads as a single unit of work.

### Java 19
1. **JEP 425: Virtual Threads (Preview)**: Introduces virtual threads to significantly reduce the complexity of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.

### Java 20
1. **JEP 429: Scoped Values (Incubator)**: Provides a mechanism to share immutable data within and across threads in a safe and efficient manner, reducing the need for synchronization.

### Java 21
1. **JEP 439: Virtual Threads**: Officially introduces virtual threads, enhancing the scalability of multithreaded applications by decoupling the application's thread management from the underlying OS threads.

### Java 22
1. **Project Loom (Finalization)**: Project Loom, which includes virtual threads and structured concurrency, is finalized, offering powerful tools to simplify concurrency and improve performance in multithreaded Java applications.

These features collectively provide more powerful, efficient, and easier-to-use tools for developers working with multithreaded applications in Java.
